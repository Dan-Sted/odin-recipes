    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Coffee cake, or kaffekuchen, is a single layer cake with a sweet, cinnamon-infused flavor and streusel top made from flour, butter, and sugar. 
        Streusel can also be layered inside of the cake like a filling. 
        Fruit variations are prevalent, with blueberry being the most common.</p>
    <p>Nuts and additional spices are often added to create deeper flavor and texture. 
        Both yeast and baking powder can be used to give lift to coffee cakes, with some versions presented as a braided ring or lattice-style.</p>
