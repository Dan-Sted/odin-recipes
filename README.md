The point of this project was to go over the basics of HTML, including boilerplate, lists, links, and images, as well as familiarize myself with the basics of git and good commit messages.

I am coming back later to this project to now add some simple CSS style things to it. The point isn't really to make everything look really nice, but to understand that basics of CSS.
